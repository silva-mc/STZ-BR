## Abstract
- Ecosystem restoration is a key strategy to jointly address the biodiversity, climate, and social inequality crises. In Brazil, large-scale seed-based restoration is gaining momentum, but a national framework to match seed sources with planting sites is still lacking, undermining long-term success.
- We developed the first Seed Transfer Zones (STZs) for Brazil using 25 environmental variables. The STZs were co-designed with Redário, a national coalition of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs) and other stakeholders engaged in the native seed supply chain. We assessed restoration supply and demand within each STZ and projected the zones to the future under contrasting climate change scenarios.
- We identified 19 STZs, distributed across Brazil’s six major vegetation regions (Amazon, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Pantanal, and Pampa). Overlaying the STZs with the legal restoration deficit (19.3 Mha) and Redário’s seed suppliers network revealed priority regions where seed supply is unlikely to meet demand (e.g., Pantanal). Future climate projections also indicate substantial reshaping of STZs, with 28–56% of Brazil’s land area expected to experience mismatches between current and future seed zones.
- The creation of Brazil’s first STZs provides a scalable framework to guide seed sourcing for restoration, aligning supply with demand, ensuring equitable and just income for IPLCs, and future-proofing projects to deliver lasting benefits for biodiversity, climate, and society.
