## Abstract
- Ecosystem restoration is key to jointly address the biodiversity, climate, and social inequality crises. In Brazil, large-scale seed-based restoration is gaining momentum, but a national framework to match seed sources with planting sites is still lacking, undermining long-term success.
- We developed the first Seed Transfer Zones (STZs) for Brazil using 25 environmental variables. We assessed restoration supply and demand within each STZ and projected the zones into the future under contrasting climate change scenarios.
- We identified 48 STZs, distributed across Brazil’s six major vegetation regions (Amazon, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Pantanal, and Pampa). Overlaying the STZs with data on seed collection capacity and restoration opportunities revealed priority regions where seed supply is unlikely to meet demand (e.g., Cerrado). Future climate projections also indicate substantial reshaping of STZs, with 51–88% of Brazil’s land area expected to experience mismatches between current and future seed zones.
- The creation of Brazil’s first STZs provides a scalable framework to guide seed sourcing for restoration, aligning supply with demand, and future-proofing projects to deliver lasting benefits for biodiversity, climate, and society.
